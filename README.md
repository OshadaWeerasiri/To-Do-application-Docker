# To-Do-application-Docker
### I am building a To-Do application to learn how Docker works. This project involves containerizing the application using Docker to ensure it runs consistently across different environments. I'll write a Dockerfile to define the application setup, create a Docker image, and run it inside a Docker container.Additionally, i'll use Docker volumes to persist user data.
